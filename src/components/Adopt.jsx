    <p>Thank you so much for considering an adoption from our shelter! 
    </p><p>You can view all of our adoptable animals here.
    </p><p>We update their availability and location in real time. 
    </p><p>If you see them, they are still available for adoption. 
    </p><p>There is no appointment needed to visit our pets.

      <p>Our goal is to find the pet that is right for YOUR family. 
      </p><p>The adoption process does require you filling out any paperwork ahead of time.
      </p><p>We recommend visiting an animal first to make sure that it is a good candidate for your home. 
      </p><p>If you decide you would like to proceed with a meet and greet, our staff can coordinate this at the shelter. 
      </p><p>We have a secured outside fenced in area next to our adoption building that provides ample space for this introduction.
